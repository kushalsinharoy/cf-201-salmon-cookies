        <h2>Company History</h2>
        <p>
          In the late 1970's Larry and Shelly Pearson were living in the
          Monterey Bay area with their one daughter and one son, Stacy and John.
          Looking for a sustainable way to support their young family, they came
          across a small cookie store in downtown Carmel and were immediately
          interested in the concept. Larry came from a strong business
          background, developed during seven years working under three very
          successful entrepreneurs, and becoming an entrepreneur himself was
          appealing to him. Shelly's artistic creativity paired with Larry's
          entrepreneurial spirit gave the Pearsons an opportunity to create
          something special. In 1980 after months of perfecting several gourmet
          recipes, the Salmon Cookie Company retail bakery was opened on the
          Pike Place Market, in Seattle, Washington. The original cookie flavors
          were Salmon Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Chip Walnut, Oatmeal Raisin,
          Peanut Butter and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip

        <p>
          The Salmon Cookie Company quickly developed a loyal cookie following
          thanks to the Pearsons' dedication to affordable gourmet cookies made
          with quality ingredients, impeccable customer service and sparkling
          clean work and retail spaces. Following the immediate success of the
          Pike Place marker store, the business expanded by delivering fresh
          baked cookies in many unique flavor combinations to retailers in San
          Francisco and Monterey Bay areas. Later, two more retail locations
          were opened within Alki Beach and at the Capitol Hill.

          />Today the company has expanded its distribution of frozen products
          throughout the Western United States. Salmon Cookie still delivers
          freshly baked cookies daily on the Northern Seattle coast and since
          1995 has sold gourmet cookie gifts online and shipped them to cookie
          lovers across the country. After 34 years, we continue to take pride
          in serving our superior fresh-baked cookies to our loyal cookie
          consumers. We use only the finest ingredients available including
          Guittard chocolate, fresh salmon, pure vanilla extract, pure cane
          sugar and unbromated-unbleached flour to make cookies that taste like
          they just popped out of the oven in your mother's kitchen. Now that is
          special!
